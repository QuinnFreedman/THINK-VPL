# THINK-VPL
Think is visual programming language and IDE written in Java for the JVM.

I wrote it in high school and it is mostly defunct now. You can see examples and read a full explanation on the at thinkvpl.org website. The website seems to be down right now but you can view a mirror of it [here](https://preview.c9users.io/quinnfreedman/think/indexIndev.html)
